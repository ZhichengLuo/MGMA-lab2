# Diffusion Models

This project is for the course of Massive Graph Management and Analytics at CentraleSup√©lec.

In this project, two diffusion models, basic **Linear Threshold (LT)** and **Independant Cascade (IC)** models, are implemented, as well as a greedy algorithm for choosing the seeds. Different ways for initializing the seeds are compared.

The data used is a Facebook social network from (SNAP)[https://snap.stanford.edu/data/ego-Facebook.html]. 

And you can see the step-by-step diffusion procedure visualized with [Animation](https://matplotlib.org/stable/api/animation_api.html).

Check more details in the notebook.
